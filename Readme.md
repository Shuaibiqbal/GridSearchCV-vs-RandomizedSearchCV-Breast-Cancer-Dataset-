# Why and When to Use GridSearchCV 

**âœ… Why use GridSearchCV:**
It exhaustively searches through a specified hyperparameter grid.

**It's best when:**

    --> You have a small number of hyperparameters.
    --> Each hyperparameter has a limited set of possible values.
    --> You want reproducibility and thoroughness.
    --> You donâ€™t mind longer training time and want the most precise tuning.

**ðŸ•’ When to use:**

    --> You know which parameters are important.
    --> You want to evaluate every possible combination.
    --> Youâ€™re tuning a simple or medium-sized model.
    --> Computational resources and time are not major constraints.

# ðŸŒ€ Why and When to Use RandomizedSearchCV
**âœ… Why use RandomizedSearchCV:**

    --> It randomly samples combinations from a parameter space.
    --> Itâ€™s much faster than grid search when the parameter space is large.
    --> You can limit the number of iterations, making it more flexible.
    --> Good at finding good results quickly, especially with non-linear models.

**ðŸ•’ When to use:**

    --> You have many hyperparameters and a large search space.
    --> Youâ€™re unsure which values to try.
    --> Youâ€™re working with limited time or resources.
    --> You want a quick and reasonable solution, not necessarily the optimal one.


## âœ… When to Use Each (from the code example)

**Scenario**	**Recommended Method**

    --> You want best performance, time is okay	        âœ… GridSearchCV
    --> You want speed and can tolerate small loss	    âš¡ RandomizedSearchCV
    --> Hyperparameter space is small (like in code)	âœ… GridSearchCV
    --> Hyperparameter space is large	                âš¡ RandomizedSearchCV

    GridSearchCV tried all 18 parameter combinations and gave slightly better or equal accuracy than RandomizedSearchCV, which only tried 10. So, use GridSearchCV when:

        --> The parameter space is small (as in the code)
        --> You want maximum accuracy 
        --> And you can afford a bit more computation time.
